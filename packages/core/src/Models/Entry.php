/**
 * One model for every user-defined entity type (ADR-010).
 *
 * Not a preference — forced. Filament caches a one-model-to-one-Resource map
 * and keys route-model binding and policies off getModel(), which must be
 * constant. Discovering that in month ten would have meant a rewrite.
 *
 * Consequences carried here: type is a discriminator column, values live in
 * JSON, per-type indexes need generated columns, and relations need a real
 * table. title/slug/status/published_at are promoted to real columns because
 * every list view, URL resolution and status filter touches them (ADR-015).
 *
